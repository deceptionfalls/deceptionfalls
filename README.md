# About me
Hi, I'm Vivi, I'm currently studying Computer Science and dabbling into the world of technology and computers, though I am mostly a hobbyist and sometimes I code for fun, not really anything serious or complex.

Some of my pinned projects include .files for my Linux system and some silly scripts I wrote for fun back then, feel free to try anything out. I make software mostly for myself but I appreciate when people take a peek at it.

**Skills**: nothing much aside from basic Python.

More to this profile coming *eventually*.
